### üß† Job Scheduling Workflow Overview

This microservice uses an event-driven architecture triggered by AWS S3 uploads.

1. **File Upload Trigger**: When a file is added to a designated S3 bucket, AWS triggers a Lambda function.
2. **Lambda Event Handling**: The Lambda extracts S3 metadata and formats it into a job payload using `JobModel`.
3. **Job Submission**: It sends an HTTP POST request to this microservice‚Äôs `/add_job` route.
4. **Persistence in MongoDB**: The backend service uses `submit_job()` to insert the job (including metadata) into the `MongoDB jobs` collection with `insert_one(job.to_dict())`.
5. **Atomic Retrieval**: Jobs are consumed via `/next_job` using `find_one_and_delete()`, ensuring atomicity and queue integrity.

This setup creates a persistent job queue system that safely handles concurrent task consumers and avoids duplicate job execution.







üîÅ Event-Driven Job Pipeline Overview
1. S3 File Upload
A user or service uploads a file to an S3 bucket.

This triggers an event notification‚Äîoften via S3 ‚Üí Lambda integration.

2. Lambda Function Execution
The Lambda function receives metadata from the S3 event (bucket name, object key, timestamp, etc).

It creates a job payload using your JobModel, possibly like:

python
job_instance = JobModel(priority=1, estimated_time=120, timestamp=s3_event_time, s3_url=s3_file_url)
3. Microservice Call
Lambda makes an HTTP POST request to your job scheduling API:

bash
POST /add_job
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "job": job_instance.to_dict()
}
4. Job Queue Microservice
Your Flask-based backend receives this via the /add_job route.

It calls:

python
scheduled_jobs_manager.submit_job(job_instance.to_dict())
Under the hood, this translates to:

python
self.collection.insert_one(job_instance.to_dict())
‚úÖ Result:
The job (including its S3 metadata) is now sitting in your MongoDB jobs collection.

This is your active queue of pending tasks‚Äîsorted and retrievable via next_job() with atomic safety.

üí° And Then What?
Workers or scheduled services can ping your /next_job route, which pulls the top-priority job using:

python
find_one_and_delete(...)
Ensuring tasks are not duplicated. Your pipeline becomes:

File ‚ûú Lambda ‚ûú Microservice ‚ûú MongoDB ‚ûú Worker




simply put ,once a file is in s3 a message notification will be send to lambda which will create a model metadater using the jobmodel and calls submit_method of job scheduling microservice who then relate to database? It then uses self.collection.insert_one(job_instance.to_dict()) to store this job (with its S3 metadata) into its MongoDB jobs collection. This is your active queue of pending tasks?
